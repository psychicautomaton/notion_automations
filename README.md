# notion_automations

These are some scripts I wrote to integrate various services and collections with Notion databases (I love notion databases!).

I use Pocket to save wishlist items and gift ideas I come across, so I wrote a script (notion_auto.py) to save those items in notion databases for my personal wishlist and gift ideas for others respectively. This script also scrapes images for each item from the Pocket link.

I use TraktTV to, well, track my TV and movie viewing, so I wrote a script (traktpub.py) that would save the data for those shows and movies to a notion database.

Lastly, I created a script (album_covers.py) to save all my Spotify liked songs in a notion database (including album covers).

Additionally, [here](https://www.notion.so/umusings/Mental-Health-Resources-5a0d3eff6c1444ab9a2181bdebc98f7d) is the notion database I created to track therapeutic techniques, skills, and exercises.
