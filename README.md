# notion_automations

These are some scripts I wrote to integrate various services and collections with Notion databases (I love notion databases!).
I use Pocket to save wishlist items and gift ideas I come across, so I wrote a script to save those items in notion databases for my personal wishlist and gift ideas for others respectively. This script also scrapes images for each item from the Pocket link.
I use TraktTV to, well, track my TV and movie viewing, so I wrote a script that would save the data for those shows and movies to a notion database.
Lastly, I created a script to save all my Spotify liked songs in a notion database (including album covers).
